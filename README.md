## About
- This is a portfolio displaying all the projects and works I have done.
- This portfolio was designed by [Jin kyu Kang](https://jinkyukang.com/work) and developed by me.

## Used
- Utilized [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/gsap/) plugin to apply animations on elements on initial page load.
- Used Tweenmax that is provided by GreenSock to dynamically control the animation timing.
- Used [ScrollMagic](https://scrollmagic.io/) along to give scroll animations.
